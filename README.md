# Detailed Objectives for the Queue Management System
## Purpose
The primary objective of this Queue Management System (QMS) is to streamline the process of visitor/customer/patient management in a organization setting. The system will be designed to handle queue allocation, and tracking for different locations/department within an organisation. The integration of barcode scanning will further automate and simplify customer check-ins, reduce wait times, and enhance the overall customer experience.

## Goals and Objectives

Goal: To reduce manual entry and speed up the customers check-in process.
Objective:
Customers will check in by scanning their barcode at designated locations.
Upon scanning, the system will direct them to a page where they fill their deatials and provide them with a queue number.
This process minimizes errors and ensures customers are directed to the correct department.

## Dynamic Queue Management

Goal: To efficiently manage customer flow across different specializations and locations within the organisation.
Objective:
The system will maintain dynamic queues for each medical specialization and location.
Customers will be assigned queue numbers based on their arrival time and the availability of Personnels.
The system will prioritize customers based on predefined criteria (e.g., urgency, appointment time) and adjust the queue accordingly.

## Doctor and Location Management

Goal: To ensure that personnels availability is optimally utilized and customers are directed to the appropriate location.
Objective:
Personnel can update their availability status in real-time, which will be reflected in the system's queue management.
The system will allocate patients to personnel based on requirement and availability, ensuring even distribution and minimizing wait times.
Each location within the organization will have a designated queue, and customers will be directed to the correct location upon check-in.
Real-Time Queue Status Updates

Goal: To keep customers informed about their position in the queue and expected wait times.
Objective:
The system will provide real-time updates to patients about their queue position and the estimated time before their consultation.
This information can be accessed via mobile devices, kiosks, or displayed on screens within the organization.

Integration with Existing Organization Systems

To ensure seamless operation and data exchange between the QMS and other Organization systems.

Goal: To provide Organisation administrators with insights into customers flow and operational efficiency.
Objective:
The system will generate reports on customers wait times, doctor utilization, queue lengths, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
These reports will help management identify bottlenecks, optimize staffing, and improve overall service delivery.
Analytics can also be used to forecast patient load based on historical data, allowing for better resource planning.
